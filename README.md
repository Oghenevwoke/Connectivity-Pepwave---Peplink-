<h2> Troubleshooting Steps (Old Device):  </h2>



The following steps were taken to troubleshoot the old Pepwave device:



1. Power Cycle: The device was powered off and on to attempt to resolve the issue.

2. Soft Reset: A soft reset was performed twice to restart the device and potentially resolve any software issues.

3. Hard Reset: A hard reset was performed twice to restore the device to its factory settings and rule out any configuration issues.

4. SIM Card Troubleshooting: The SIM card was ejected and reinserted to ensure proper connectivity and rule out any issues with the SIM card.

5. Power Cycle (Again): After the SIM card troubleshooting, the device was powered off and on again to test if the issue would be resolved.



<h2> Outcome:  </h2>



Despite these efforts, the device continued to indicate a flashy green light, suggesting that the issue remains unresolved.



<h2> Escalation and Resolution:  </h2>



After the initial troubleshooting steps were unsuccessful, I contacted Remote support , who connected me to L3 Internal support, a network specialist. I provided XXX with detailed information about the troubleshooting steps I had taken. Despite these efforts, XXX was unable to locate the device on the network and determined that it was non-functional. XXX marked the device as "Dead" and instructed me to install the new Pepwave device.



I proceeded to install the new device, and upon completion, the new device was successfully brought online and became live on the network.



<h2> Check-out:  </h2>



After resolving the issue, I checked in with L2 Remote Support to confirm the successful installation and signed out at 5:15 pm, marking the completion of the task.



<h2> Outcome:  </h2>



The installation of the new Pepwave device successfully resolved the issue, and the location's network is now functioning as expected.
